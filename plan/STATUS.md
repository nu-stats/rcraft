# Status

Last updated: 2026-10-26.

**Phase 0 (setup): scaffolded, not yet committed.** The Cargo workspace,
layered crates, licence files, `NOTICE`, `cargo xtask ci` and the CI workflow
exist on branch `p0/scaffold`.

## Done

- P0.1 Workspace and layered crates (L0 to L7, empty except `core`,
  `catalog` and `rcraft-cli`)
- P0.2 Contributor rules, MIT and Apache-2.0 licences, `NOTICE`
- P0.3 `cargo xtask ci`: fmt, clippy, tests, layers, assets, coverage
- P0.4 Coverage inventory (`crates/catalog`, `docs/coverage.md`)
- P0.6 CI workflow for Windows, macOS and Linux (not yet run: no remote)

## P1.3 and P1.4 (R session), 2026-10-26

- `rproto`: the wire format (requests, tab-separated frames led by a random
  per-session token, escaping), and the R loop it talks to
  (`crates/rproto/src/bootstrap.R`). 8 unit tests.
- `rhost::Session`: starts R, `run`, streamed `Event`s (output, warnings,
  errors, finished, exited), `interrupt`, `restart`, `run_to_end`. Output is
  capped per run and the channel is bounded. 16 tests start a real R (skipped
  with a note when none is installed) and pass here against R 4.4.3: state
  persists, errors and parse errors, warnings versus messages, unicode, long
  lines, huge output, crash then restart. No R processes were left behind.
- `rcraft --eval "R code"` runs code through a session.
- Interrupt: on Unix it sends SIGINT (`kill -INT`); that path is written but
  untested here (this machine is Windows), so CI on Linux and macOS is its
  first check. On Windows there is no way to signal R without `unsafe`, which
  is forbidden, so interrupt stops the session and the caller restarts it;
  the objects in memory are lost. Windows is tested and works that way.
  Better ideas to weigh later: keep a checkpoint of the workspace so a stop
  can restore it, or a vetted safe wrapper for console control events.
- Output is line-buffered by R when piped, so progress text can arrive late
  unless the code calls `flush.console()`.
- Standard output and standard error are read on separate threads, so their
  relative order is approximate.
- Windows interrupt: decided 2026-10-26 to keep stop-and-restart for now.

## P1.4 supervision, 2026-10-26

- R reports its own process id in the READY frame. On Windows `Rscript`
  starts R as a child, so this is the id to measure and signal.
- `SessionConfig::max_run_time`: a run over it is interrupted
  (`Event::LimitReached`, `Limit::Time`); if R is still going 10 seconds
  later (code that never checks for interrupts) it is stopped outright.
- `SessionConfig::max_memory_bytes`: R's memory is read every 2 seconds
  during a run with `tasklist` (Windows) or `ps` (elsewhere), so there is no
  `unsafe` code; over the limit R is stopped (`Limit::Memory`) because a
  process out of memory may not answer an interrupt. Restart to go on.
- Both limits are off by default; the interface will set them.
- Tested against R 4.4.3 here: the time limit, the memory limit (a 640 MB
  vector against a 300 MB limit) and restart afterwards. The `ps` path is
  covered only by its parser tests, since this is a Windows machine; CI on
  Linux and macOS runs the real thing.
- Not covered: a hung R that is idle (not in a run) and does not answer. The
  time limit covers hung runs only.

## Not done

- CI (GitHub Actions, run on `p0/scaffold`): the first run failed on Ubuntu
  only; the cause was real, standard error text could arrive after the
  end-of-run frame and be dropped. R now sends a SYNC frame on standard
  error before END and a run finishes only when both are in. The second run
  passed on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS, so the Unix interrupt, the `ps`
  memory check and the pinned-R step all work.

## Phase 2 so far, 2026-10-26

- P2.1 history and recall: `engine::history` (`History`, `Recall`): the
  commands run, the Page Up/Down and arrow stepping that returns to the
  half-typed text, blank and repeated commands skipped, capped at 10,000.
- P2.3 results: `engine::results`, one block per command, text joined,
  errors, warnings and notices kept apart, capped at 64 MB.
- P2.4 log and script: `engine::transcript`; the log (`> code`, output) can
  also follow into a file; the script keeps only commands that ran without
  error, with a comment naming menu entries.
- `Engine` ties a session to these; `submit` and `poll` are all an interface
  needs. 17 unit tests and 9 integration tests against real R pass.
- `rcraft` with no arguments is a terminal console on the engine (one
  command per line, `:history`, `:log`, `:script`, `:restart`, `:quit`).
- Top-level errors read `Error: message`, not R's internal call.
- Not done: P2.2 Tab completion, the egui window (Command, Results,
  History panes), multi-line input (a line that is an unfinished R
  statement should wait for more, not fail), the clicking of History
  entries.
- Windows Application Control sometimes blocks a freshly built test or app
  binary (os error 4551); running it again a little later works. All checks,
  including `cargo xtask ci`, now pass here.

## Decisions made

- Architecture: RCraft **drives a real R** as a separate child process. It
  does not reimplement R and never links `libR` (keeps the licence MIT OR
  Apache-2.0).
- Layered Rust crates and the catalog-of-dialog-specs model follow StatCraft.
- Generated R code is the product: every menu action shows and logs R.

- Added 2026-10-26: Phase 1A (Packages: search, describe, install, update;
  the `ssc install` and `net search` equivalent, with `rc install` and `rc
  search` command forms) and Phase 2A (Help: R help pages, help search,
  vignettes, per-dialog help). Network rules are in AGENTS.md section 1 and
  `docs/network.md`.

- Added 2026-10-26: Phase 2B (Stata mode): a switch and button that take
  Stata code, translate it to R, show both side by side and run the R. A
  translator, not Stata; unsupported commands are marked, never guessed.
  Clean-room rules in AGENTS.md section 1; new `statatr` crate planned at L3.
- P1.1 (find installed R) is done and committed; R is not installed on this
  machine, so `rcraft --find-r` reports none.

- Researched 2026-10-26: run an existing do-file on R (`plan/do-file-run.md`,
  Phase 2C). No mature tool exists; StatCraft's parsers are reusable.
  Recommended approach: idiomatic R plus a small shipped R runtime package
  for Stata-specific rules; verified against recorded Stata output.

## Decided 2026-10-26 (open items worked)

- P0.5: `ENVIRONMENT` pins R 4.4.3 and a package snapshot dated 2025-03-15;
  CI installs that R with `r-lib/actions/setup-r`. Neither the snapshot date
  nor the CI step has run yet (no remote), so the first CI run confirms them.
- Pinokio's conda installs are found with no setting: Pinokio's home comes
  from `PINOKIO_HOME` or `~/.pinokio/config.json`, then `bin/miniforge` and
  `bin/miniconda`. `rcraft --find-r` now reports R 4.4.3 on this machine.
- Do not install packages into another app's environment. The R found here
  belongs to Husky Eye View (`hev-r`, 62 packages, no tidyverse). RCraft uses
  its own user library for installs (P1.5, Phase 1A).
- Shared parsers: extract StatCraft's do-file reader, syntax and expression
  parsers into a shared crate when P2C.3 starts, and depend on that; do not
  copy them here. That change is made in the StatCraft repository, so it is
  not done from this one and needs the maintainer's go-ahead.
- `rcraftstata` (the shipped R runtime package) lives in this repository
  under `r/rcraftstata/` and is installed into RCraft's own user library on
  first use, with the user's yes. Created when P2C.4 starts.

## Open questions

- (Decided: Windows interrupt stays stop-and-restart; see P1.4 above.) Was: a
  checkpoint so a stop does not lose the workspace?
- Next: P1.4 watchdog and memory limit, P1.2 (download a portable R when
  none is found), then Phase 2 (Command window and Results).

- Stata mode: share StatCraft's parser (`lang` crate) or write a new one?
  Proposed: start from StatCraft's if its licence and layering allow.
- Stata mode output: R's own output first; Stata-style tables later.

- Phase 1A providers: CRAN and Bioconductor first; r-universe and GitHub
  after? Download counts from a third-party service are optional.

- Generated code style default: tidyverse with a base-R toggle (proposed).
- Public name check for "RCraft"; the repository URL in `Cargo.toml` is a
  placeholder.
- Portable R source for first-run download on each platform.
- First milestone: Phases 0 to 3 as a usable "open a file, look at it,
  clean it, run R commands" app, before any statistics menus.

## Next tasks

- Commit the scaffold (P0.1 to P0.4, P0.6)
- P0.5 pin R and the package snapshot
- P1.1 find an installed R

## Desktop window, 2026-10-26

- Layout B (Workbench) is built in egui (`crates/ui-egui`, app in
  `apps/rcraft-desktop`): menu bar, Variables over History on the left,
  Script above Results, Command line with Run and Stop, and a status bar.
  Page Up/Down and the arrows recall earlier commands, clicking a History
  entry puts it back, Ctrl+Enter in the Script runs the selection or the
  current line. Accents (7, Teal default) and light/dark are under Edit.
  Variables and the Data, Statistics, Graphs, Packages menus are
  placeholders until those phases.
- Drawing uses `wgpu` first and OpenGL as the fallback. On this machine
  neither opens (OpenGL 2.0 not available; `wgpu` finds no adapter), in the
  user's own terminal as well as mine, and StatCraft's window fails the same
  way. Cause found: Windows reports the Radeon RX 570 with device error
  Code 31 (its graphics driver does not load; the driver is dated 2023-03-29
  on Windows build 26300), so only Microsoft's basic display adapter is in
  use. Not a remote session. A reboot or a newer AMD driver should fix it;
  the user did not want to reboot yet, and Win+Ctrl+Shift+B did not help.
- So the window can be seen without a GPU:
  `rcraft-desktop --picture FILE.png [--demo FILE] [--dark] [--accent NAME]`
  draws the real window to a PNG on the CPU (`softraster.rs`, `headless.rs`),
  with a live R session. Layout B was checked this way, light and dark.
  The live window now falls back to the same CPU drawing when neither `wgpu`
  nor OpenGL can start (`softwindow.rs`, winit and softbuffer), or with
  `rcraft-desktop --software`. Checked here: it opens, titled RCraft, and
  responds; how it looks and feels on screen still needs a person to confirm.
  Dev builds optimise the drawing crates (root `Cargo.toml` profile) so it is
  usable without a release build.
- Building on this Windows machine: the Rust toolchain is the GNU one and the
  newer `windows-sys` crates need `dlltool` and `as`, which are not
  installed. `Cargo.lock` was seeded from StatCraft's, and the build worked
  with the MinGW binutils from the Husky Eye View R environment appended to
  `PATH` (`...\envs\hev-r\Library\x86_64-w64-mingw32\bin` and `...\Library\bin`).
  Installing MinGW (or the Visual Studio build tools) would be cleaner.

## Data-bridge spike and CI, 2026-10-26

- Pushed through `1fe9532`; CI: Windows and macOS passed, Ubuntu failed to
  build (no X11 development libraries on the runner). Fixed in `7a4d455`
  (apt install step in `ci.yml`), not yet pushed.
- Data bridge (`plan/data-bridge.md`): a base-R-only binary column format
  beats delimited text (write 0.38 s vs 7.4 s, read 0.09 s vs 1.1 s, 54 MB vs
  82 MB for 1M rows) and keeps types and missing values. Arrow and Parquet not
  yet measured (need the `arrow` install, which needs the user's yes);
  Application Control blocked `data.table`'s DLL, so no compiled package can be
  assumed. Phase 3 may start once the user has read the recommendation.
